            <h2>About Bitcoin</h2>
            <p>The Bitcoin network is the world's largest and most secure computer network. 100% of global Bitcoin node operators are unregulated. As a result, no single government, bank, or corporation can control it.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the network's native token, bitcoin, is entirely permissionless. It is impossible to stop criminals from using it because of the aformentioned decentralized network. While most "bitcoiners" use this native token as an alternative money, due to it's limited supply and savings value, many use it for illicit purposes.</p>
            <p>We are hard at work highlighting high profile, international cases so the public is aware of the many ways criminals use this network.</p>
